# GestureControlCar
This is gesture control car code snippet using opencv python

## How it works:
Here Main idea is of colour detection using opencv. In my case in I have detected red colour.
And based on its location on screen, which is divided in four parts, it presses key using pyautogui module.
I have also included functionality to record and save your webcam and screen recording.


## Installing:
To run code o your machine, you should have installed pyhton 3, I have tested this code on
1. opencv 4.2.0
2. PIL 7.0.0
3. pyautogui 0.9.50
